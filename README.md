# kinky-fun-for-fouR

Project developed during [Berlin Creative Code](http://creativecode.berlin/) Jam on
the 20th of July 2019

We wanted to control lasers and LEDs brought to the jam by
[Nu√±o de la Serna](https://action-io.com/). The idea was to capture body movement in space with
the Kinect depth camera and map it to spatial illumination.
