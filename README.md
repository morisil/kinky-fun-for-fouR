# kinky-fun-for-fouR

Project developed during [Berlin Creative Code](http://creativecode.berlin/) Jam on
the 20th of July 2019

We wanted to control lasers and LEDs brought to the jam by
[Nu√±o de la Serna](https://action-io.com/). The idea was to capture body movement in space with
the Kinect depth camera and map it to the spatial illumination. We wanted to evoke conflicting
emotions related to exploration of such a space.

We are using Processing and OpenNI for skeleton tracking.
